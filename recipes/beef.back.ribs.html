    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>  Basically, covered, 275 °F, 4 hours but you can go up to 5 hr. 6 is probably fine too. Can turn the heat down to, say, 200 °F after 4 hours as a good option.</p>
    <p>Some recipes indicate that you should turn the ribs upside down in the pan for cooking. I've tried this and as far as I can tell, it's a wash. I typically place them rightside up because with the ribs curving upward, less of the meat becomes submerged in the rendered fat during cooking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Back Ribs, 2 racks (~5 lb)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large, shallow baking pans</li>
        <li>Aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Potholder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay the ribs rightside up (or upside down if you prefer), one rack of ribs on each tray.</li>
        <li>Cover the ribs with foil.</li>
        <li>Place both pans into the oven. Set the temperature to 275 degF.</li>
        <li>You can check on the ribs after 4 hr. The ribs in the pan that you placed on a higher up rack in the oven will cook more slowly.</li>
    </ol>
