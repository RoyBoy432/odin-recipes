    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>This is the old cooking method I used early in grad school when I was obsessed with trying random cooking methods off the Internet. When this one worked, I could stop frantically searching.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Leg Quarters, as many as you are going to eat (Probably 2 or 3)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 baking pan for roasting the chicken</li>
        <li>1 baking pan of equal or larger size to cover the roasting pan</li>
        <li>Potholder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the chicken to room temperature for a couple of hours. Rinse the chicken and place it in your roasting pan. Preheat the oven to 350° F.</li>
        <li>Place the roasting pan, covered, into the hot oven for 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 60 minutes, remove the cover and cook for another 30 minutes, still at 350° F.</li>
        <li>After the total of 90 minutes, your food is ready. I let it stand 10 minutes before eating, but who knows if that was necessary.</li>
    </ol>
